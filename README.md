# mygithelper

This is a toy project to learn golang. The idea of the project is based on this course: [Write Professional Command-line Programs in Go](https://www.educative.io/courses/prof-command-line-programs-go)

## Description

This is a wrapper aroung git. The tool provides a set of commands that replaicate or extend the existing git functionality. Also, this tool allows to apply this command recursively in several repositories.

In general this repository is going trough the same steps as the course, so the first commit starts from the simpliest possible version and every next one gradually improve the repo.

**General usage:**
- `mgh [-r] COMMAND`

**Commands:**
- `mgh addall`
- `mgh commit`
- `mgh push`
- `mgh pull`
- `mgh clean branches`

**Thigs to add later:**
- `mgh init <folders>`
- `mgh add all`
- `mgh add py`
- `mgh add go`
